Employee Data Management Task
This task was completed as part of the Information Technology Institute (ITI) curriculum. The objective was to create a table displaying employee data with functionalities for deleting and editing records. I expanded the project by adding the following features:

Sorting: Enable sorting by name, position, office, age, and date in both ascending and descending order by clicking on any column header.
Real-Time Search and Filtering: Implement a real-time search bar and a dropdown menu to filter results by name, position, office, or age.
Add New Employee Data: Add a button to input new employee data, ensuring the validity of each entry. This includes preventing the addition of duplicate employee records.
Clear Input Fields: Include a clear button to reset all input fields easily.
Local Storage: Store all data securely in the browser's local storage.
